# Sparkline Charts

Sparkline charts are small charts plotted within a grid chart, without
any axes, labels or other chart elements. They are meant to represent
trends and their progression in a given date range.

The first column remains fixed in the Visualization Editor, allowing
you to scroll through the different columns in your information.

    addition, you can also choose whether you want to **represent a
    positive difference in green or red**.
