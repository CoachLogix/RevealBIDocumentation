:::info ARM Unsupported

Currently ARM devices are not supported. However, if running a Mac M1 (ARM) with Rosetta installed you can use the following workaround:
1. Make sure you install reveal-sdk-node with the --ignore-scripts parameters, like this:  npm i -P reveal-sdk-node --ignore-scripts
2. Download the [RevealEngine binary](https://dl.infragistics.com/reveal/Builds/sdk/node-binaries/v0.6.0/osx-x64/RevealEnginePrg.gz)
3. Extract the binary from the downloaded file, and place it somewhere within the development folder.
4. Start reveal with the `_internal_revealEnginePrgPath` parameter. Be sure to provide the correct path to the `RevealEnginePrg`.  
```ts
const revealOptions: RevealOptions = {
    _internal_revealEnginePrgPath: './RevealEnginePrg'
};
app.use('/', reveal(revealOptions));
```

If Mac restricts downloading the binary, go to **Settings -> Privacy**, and allow the binary.

## Installing the Reveal SDK (Windows)

To install the Reveal SDK, you need to download and execute the Reveal SDK Installer. To achieve this, use the following steps:
1. Download the Reveal SDK Installer from the [Reveal website](https://www.revealbi.io/download-sdk)
2. Fill out the "Try the Reveal SDK" form on the webpage
3. Save the Reveal SDK installer to a known location on your disk

Before extracting the saved Reveal SDK Installer zip file, you should unblock it. Right-click the zip file and select **Properties**. The properties dialog will appear with a checkbox option to unblock the file. Check the **Unblock** option and press **Apply**.

Once the installation is complete, you should have the following items installed in the local folder **"%public%\Documents\Infragistics\Reveal\SDK\"**:

## Adding Your License Key

By default, when you install the Reveal SDK only the **trial** product is used. In order to unlock the **licensed** product, you must provide a license key in the application.
