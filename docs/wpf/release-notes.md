# Release Notes

## 1.4.1 (April 4th, 2023)
_This is a nuget.org only update._

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes error `Failed to add reference to 'libigsslic32'.` when referencing the Reveal WPF SDK using the Nuget Package Manager.

## 1.4.0 (Feb-2023)

### Breaking Changes
* Category Charts have a new look & feel. The old L&F is deprecated but if needed for whatever reason, they're can be restored by doing `revealSdkSettings.enableNewCharts = false`.
* Subtitles for Data Source Items are no longer autogenerated. Only the Subtitle property is considered.

### New Features
* New API `onFieldsInitializing` that makes it possible to customize the list of fields shown in the visualization editor, by removing, renaming or reordering fields. Usage example: 
```
revealView.onFieldsInitializing = function (args) {
	args.fields = args.fields.filter(f => !["Avg.CPC", "Avg. CPC"].some(e => e == f.name));
};
```
* BigQuery, Snowflake and Athena now support the `CustomQuery` property
* Snowflake - Allow setting `Warehouse` property from sdk

### Bug Fixes

* Inconsistent time part for dates sent in the range parameter of `onDateFilterChanged`
* Inconsistent day shown in the global filter range selector, when using 'Today' or 'Yesterday' two different days were displayed.
