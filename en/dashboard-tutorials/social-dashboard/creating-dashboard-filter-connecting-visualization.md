## Creating the Dashboard Filter and Connecting your Visualization

The dashboard displayed [in the first page of this tutorial](getting-started.md) is connected to a [date range dashboard filter](~/en/filters/date-range-filter.md). These kinds of filters enable a
time-based scenario analysis. When connected to all visualizations, they
allow for users to dynamically filter their whole dashboard.

In order create the filter, you will need to:

1.  Select the **Add Filter** button under your dashboard's name, and
    then **Add Date Filter**

2.  Under **Date Filter**, select **Last Year**.

    <img src="images/AddLastYearFilter_All.png" alt="AddLastYearFilter\_All" class="responsive-img"/>

Once the date filter has been created, you will need to connect it to
your existing visualization. In order to do so:

1.  Select the **Connect** button in the **YTD Twitter Followers**
    visualization. Reveal will attempt to connect the dashboard filter
    to a field in your visualization.

    If you select **Date Filter**, you will be able to edit the
    connection if necessary.

}
