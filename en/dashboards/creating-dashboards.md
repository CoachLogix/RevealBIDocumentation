If your data source is a spreadsheet in a content manager, you will be
able to select, for example, the specific sheet that you want to use in
your visualization.

#### Available Content

With Reveal, you can add many content sources, including
[Dropbox](~/en/datasources/supported-data-sources/Dropbox.md), [OneDrive](~/en/datasources/supported-data-sources/OneDrive.md), [Box](~/en/datasources/supported-data-sources/Box.md) and [Google Drive](~/en/datasources/supported-data-sources/Google-Drive.md), which will allow you to browse any folders, files

In addition, you can also add [SharePoint](~/en/datasources/supported-data-sources/SharePoint.md) data sources,
which means the ability to access any lists or libraries.

### Changing your Visualization

Once your data source has been added, you will be taken to the Visualizations Editor. By default, the Pivot visualization will be selected.

Reveal provides several options to customize the way your information is visualized; you can access the options by selecting the **grid icon** in the top bar.

Add labels and values to your visualization and preview them in the
right-hand pane. If necessary, you can change your visualization's
settings or add filters to it.

Once you have modified the visualization, you will be taken back to the
**Dashboard Editor**. You will see **Undo**, **Redo**, and the **+Visualization** split button on the top right-hand corner. Next to these buttons you will also find the overflow menu of the dashboard where you can choose to change the dashboard theme, switch on/off **Auto Layout**, **export** or **save** the dashboard.

You can also use the overflow menu in the top right corner of the visualizations to rename, edit, **copy** or **duplicate** them.

>[NOTE!] The **difference between copying and duplicating** a visualization is that duplicating works only inside the same dashboard and the copy option allows you to put the visualization in the same or a different dashboard.

After copying a visualization, find the _Paste_ option inside the overflow menu of the dashboard you want to paste the visualization in.

menu â‡’ *Theme* and switch between *Mountain Theme* and *Ocean Theme* as
shown below.

### Save the Dashboard

Once your dashboard is ready, save it by either selecting the **tick icon** in the top right-hand corner or by accessing the **Save As**
option in the overflow menu.

You can save your dashboard in your personal repository, or choose any
team repositories you have [joined or created](~/en/teams/Creating-Joining-Teams.md).
Select a name for your dashboard, and, when ready, click/tap **Save here**.
