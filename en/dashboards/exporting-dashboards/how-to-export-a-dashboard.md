# Export Dashboards

The information displayed in dashboards will change over time as the
data changes in the data source, but there will be scenarios where you
can benefit from sharing a snapshot of the data at that specific moment
in time. For instance, to highlight an unexpected value that may provide
some business insight and requires attention right away.

In order to **access the export feature**, select the overflow button in
the top right-hand corner and click/tap *Export*.
