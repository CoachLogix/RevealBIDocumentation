# Sharing Dashboards


Shared dashboards are ideal for cross-team collaboration. There are so
many possibilities when it comes to sharing in Reveal. 

Here you will find more information about the permission roles and the available sharing scenarios:

  - [sharing dashboards created by you with other users](#sharing-dashboards-users),

  - [sharing your workspace's dashboards with other users](#sharing-workspace-dashboard),

  - [sharing a dashboard with a whole workspace](#sharing-dashboard-with-workspace).

> [!NOTE]
> **Sharing Folders**. Rules for dashboards sharing in this article also apply to sharing folders.

## Sharing Your Own Dashboards with Other Users

To share a dashboard created by you with individual users you need to:

1.  Access the *Share dialog* - Open the overflow menu and choose **Shared With**.

  Once you share a folder with other people, the new files will appear in their accounts as well under the **Shared with Me** section in the left panel. Alternatively they can find the files when they open **My Analytics** and click/tap on **Shared with Me** that is under **Filters**.

2.  **Choose the users** you want to share the dashboard with - Enter the e-mail addresses or the names of the people you want to invite and click/tap on **Done**.

3.  After selecting the users, click/tap *Update*. The dashboard is shared automatically with members of your [Organization](~/en/workspaces/overview.html#organization-workspace). Other users will have the dashboard shared with them only after they accept the invitation.

**You can change the access level for users at any time when you are the owner of the dashboard** by accessing
the Share menu. You will see a list of all users you have shared the
dashboard with and their access level. You can change their access level
by selecting a new one from the dropdown menu next to their name.

**When you are the owner of the dashboard, you can also unshare it at any time** by accessing the
Share dialog and selecting *Remove* from the dropdown menu next to any
member's name.

In general, a user can have one of the following permissions:

  - **Owner** permissions - the user can create, edit, share and delete.

  - **Contributor** permissions - the user can create, edit and share but cannot delete a dashboard or folder. They can only edit the visualizations in the dashboard. If a list of dashboards has been shared with the user, they can remove the dashboads in the list but can't delete the list in itself.

  - **Viewer** permissions - the user can view a dashboard. They can also share it with another user after the approval of the owner.

    but cannot delete them.

  - **Viewer** - can view and share dashboards for view only.

Here you can see the access permissions options every workspace member can give when sharing a dashboard:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-oav7{color:rgb(88, 88, 88);font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}
</style>

<table class="tg">
 <tr>
    <th class="tg-oav7" rowspan="2">Workspace Roles</th>
    <th class="tg-t96r" colspan="3">Access Permissions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-baqh">Owner</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">Contributor</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">Viewer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Owner</td>
    <td><span style="color: #007F00">Yes</span></td>
    <td><span style="color: #007F00">Yes</span></td>
    <td><span style="color: #007F00">Yes</span></td>
  </tr>

Any member of a workspace can share the workspace's dashboards with other users. To do this, go to the *Workspaces* tab and choose a dashboard from the *Dashboards* section. Then, follow the steps in [Sharing your Own Dashboard with Other Users](#sharing-dashboards-users). Keep in mind that the owner of the workspace needs to approve the request first in order for a member to share a dashboard with another member.

## Sharing a Dashboard with a Whole Workspace

You can share a dashboard you created or a workspace's dashboard with a whole
workspace instead of individually with every workspace member. To do this, choose
a dashboard from the *Dashboards* section in *My Analytics* or *Workspaces* tab.
Then follow the steps in [Sharing your Own Dashboards with Other Users](#sharing-dashboards-users).

>[!NOTE]
>You can share a dashboard with any public workspace that is part of the [Organization](~/en/workspaces/overview.html#organization-workspace), whether you are a member of it or not. You can also share with private workspaces that you are a member of.

When you have used a data source file located on a cloud service to build a dashboard, you will need to grant access to this file to successfully share your dashboard. To learn more, read [Sharing Dashboards with Cloud Files as a Data Source](sharing-dashboards-datasource-files-cloud-provider.md).
