## Connecting a Dashboard to Its Data Source

In Reveal, you can connect to a data source [before](overview.md) or after a dashboard is created. Connecting to a data source is part of the dashboard creation process. However, you can have a dashboard, which is already created, but still not connected to a data source. There are two scenarios where this can happen: this dashboard is [shared](~/en/dashboards/sharing-dashboards/share-a-dashboard.md) with you, or you have [uploaded](uploading-dashboards.md) it to Reveal. 

A dashboard created with data sources you have not yet added into your application will look like shown below, when you open it for the first time:

Once ready, the complete dashboard will be displayed in *Dashboard View* mode. If you need to edit the data in it, you can do so by accessing the **Dashboard Edit** mode from the overflow menu.
