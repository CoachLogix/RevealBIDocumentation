# Data Sources

Data Sources are the places where your data comes from. Reveal provides you with the opportunity to connect to different enterprise data sources. You can choose from analytics tools, content managers, cloud services, CRMs,
databases, spreadsheets, and public data sources.

## Connecting to Data Sources

To retrieve information from a data source and use it for your visualizations you need to connect to it first. Once you have connected to a data source, it will be saved in the *Data Sources* menu for quick selection next time you need it (see the screenshot above).

To connect to a data source, perform the steps below:

1. Go to *My Analytics* or a workspace where you want to a create a dashboard. 
2. Click/tap on the **+ Dashboard** or **Create Dashboard** *(My Analytics)* blue button.

3. In the *+ Visualization* dialog, you will see a list of recently used data sources. To create a new connection, select the **+ Data Source** button on the right.

After selecting a data source provider, you will be prompted to **configure** it. Not sure how to do this? Find out in the article about the chosen data source (see the list below).
