After authorizing Reveal to use your data, you can use your *OneDrive* files to build visualizations.

## Supported Files

When working within Reveal, you will be able to use a wide variety of
files:

  - **Spreadsheets**: Excel (.xls, .xlsx) or CSV, which you can use
    dynamically within Reveal.

  - **Other files** (including images or document files such as PDFs,
    texts, etc.), which will be displayed in a preview mode only.
