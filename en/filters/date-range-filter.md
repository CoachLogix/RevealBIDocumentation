# Date Range Dashboard Filter

Reveal supports enabling a range of dates as dashboard filters to bind
your data to. This enables time-based analysis scenarios, changing one
date range and filtering the whole dashboard. In order to enable the
date range in the dashboard filters section, you will need to select the
**Add Date Filter** option in the **Add Filter** menu.
