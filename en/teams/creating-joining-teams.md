## Creating and Joining Teams

*Teams* in Reveal enables easy collaboration within and out of your
organization. Now you can access and join freely all your organization's
teams and also make your own team available for others in the
organization to join and work with you.

Start using Teams by [creating a team from scratch](#create-team-scratch) or [joining an existing team](#join-team).

  >[!NOTE]
  > When signing in for the first time, you might already have a team. This is your [Organization team](overview.html#organization-team) including other members of your organization, who have logged in Reveal with their Office365 account at least once.



2.  Click/Tap the *+ Create Team* blue button. The following screen
    opens:

    ![team properties dialog](images/create-team-properties.png)

    Here you will need to:

      - assign a *name* to your team;

      - choose if your team will belong to the main *Organization*.

          - [Organization team](overview.html#organization-team) (this
            option will appear with the name of your organization, e.g.
            *Infragistics, Inc*) - if you associate your team with the
            main Organization team, your team will appear in the list of
            teams that every member of the main Organization can
            [join](#join-team) (unless you make your team private).

          - *Personal organization* - your new team does not belong to
            the main Organization and cannot be joined by other users
            without invitation.

            >[!NOTE]
            >Carefully choose the *Organization* property for your team as you cannot change it later.
      - decide on team's [*privacy*](overview.html#team-privacy-levels) - this option will not be availabe if you choose _Personal Organization_ for your team.

      - configure _branding_ settings - choose a main color and logo to be used when the teams' dashboards are exported as [PDF documents](~/en/dashboards/exporting-dashboards/export-as-pdf-document.md) and [PPT presentations](~/en/dashboards/exporting-dashboards/export-as-powerpoint-presentation).

        >[!NOTE] **Requirements for logo images**. The image you upload for a logo must be no bigger than **5 MB** and one of the following formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif.

3.  Click/Tap *Create*. Your team is now created and you can find it in the teams' list on the left side of the screen.

4. After you create your team, you will be prompted to invite members. Click/tap the    
the *+ Members* blue button. You can choose members from the dropdown list (see below) or use the search bar to add the emails of users who are outside of your Organization. Select _Done_ when you are ready.
